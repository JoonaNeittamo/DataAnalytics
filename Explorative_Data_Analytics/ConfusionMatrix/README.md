# Diabetes Diagnosis Prediction

This project uses a Decision Tree Classifier to predict diabetes diagnosis based on a set of medical features.

## Code Description

### Data Loading and Preprocessing

- **Load Data**: Reads the dataset from a CSV file.
- **Feature Selection**: Separates the features from the target variable.

### Model Training

- **Train-Test Split**: Splits the data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Trains a Decision Tree model with specified parameters.

### Visualization

- **Decision Tree Graph**: Creates and visualizes the decision tree.

### Evaluation

- **Prediction**: Makes predictions on the test set.
- **Accuracy**: Calculates and prints the accuracy score.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Generates and plots the confusion matrix to evaluate model performance.
